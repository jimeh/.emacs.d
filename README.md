# jimeh's .emacs.d (a.k.a. Emacs Siren)

This is my personal Emacs config, currently nicknamed Emacs Siren, and heavily
inspired by [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude).

However, this is not some form of an Emacs starter kit, it's simply my personal
config with any quirks, oddities, bugs, and man-eating errors I live with on a
daily basis.

## Requirements

- Emacs 25.3 or later. Earlier versions might work, but I haven't tested them.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo to `~/.emacs.d`, and update git submodules:

        git clone git://github.com/jimeh/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
        cd ~/.emacs.d

2. Launch Emacs and wait a few minutes while it installs all packages.
3. Enjoy ^_^

## Why not use Emacs Prelude?

Prelude is nice and all, but I don't need everything it does. I need a config
that does what I need without having to potentially counter and/or work against
some config framework. Hence I prefer rolling my own.

The way Prelude structures it's files and code however is very great, and
something I took to heart when I started working on a rewrite of my config, and
hence Emacs Siren was born.

## Why call my config Emacs Siren?

I had been playing a lot of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and decided to pick a name
based on a enemy type from the game. "Siren" was short and kinda cool sounding.

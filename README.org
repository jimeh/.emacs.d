* jimeh's .emacs.d (a.k.a. Emacs Siren)

  This is my personal Emacs config, currently nicknamed Emacs Siren, and heavily
  inspired by [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Emacs Prelude]].

  However, this is not some form of an Emacs starter kit, it's simply my
  personal config with any quirks, oddities, bugs, and man-eating errors I live
  with on a daily basis.

** Requirements

   - Emacs 26.1 or later.

** Installation

   1. Clone the repo to =~/.emacs.d=:
      #+BEGIN_SRC
        git clone git://github.com/jimeh/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
      #+END_SRC
   2. Launch Emacs and wait a few minutes while it installs all packages.
   3. Enjoy ^_^

** Why not use Emacs Prelude?

   Prelude is nice and all, but I don't need everything it does. I need a config
   that does what I need without having to potentially counter and/or work
   against some config framework. Hence I prefer rolling my own.

   The way Prelude structures it's files and code however is very great, and
   something I took to heart when I started working on a rewrite of my config,
   and hence Emacs Siren was born.

** Why call my config Emacs Siren?

   I had been playing a lot of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and decided to pick a
   name based on a enemy type from the game. "Siren" was short and kinda cool
   sounding.

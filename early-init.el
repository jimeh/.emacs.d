;;; early-init.el --- jimeh's Emacs Siren: early init file.

;;; Commentary:

;; The file before the file that starts it all.

;;; Code:

;; Native-Comp

    (setcar comp-eln-load-path eln-cache-dir)

    ;; sized *.eln files behind. Hence delete such files during startup.

;; Disable Emacs 27's automatic package.el initialization before the init.el
;; file is loaded. I use straight.el instead of package.el.

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the

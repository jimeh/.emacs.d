;; Basic configuration for terraform-mode.

(use-package terraform-mode

  :config
  ;; This does a better job of injecting formatted content than the default
  ;; formatting commands included with terraform-mode.
  (reformatter-define terraform-format

    :lighter " fmt"))

    ;; syntax highlighting as you type. Essentially all new text is a very faded
    ;; out grey color for the first 1-2 seconds as you type.
